ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noureldeen Amr, a computer science and engineering student at the GUC who spends time learning and creating ideas and projects.
  
I believe in order to become succesful, one has to both learn and create. I have spent years learning and continue to, and recently I am focusing on developing a creative mindset, with which I hope to use to express myself through my projects.

If you have any questions/offers, I'll gladly answer you if you send an email to nooreldeen.ay@gmail.com.
